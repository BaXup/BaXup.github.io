<p>BaXup, a git-based cross-folder backup application written in SwiftUI.</p>

<h3 id="why-this">Why this?</h3>

<p>I’ve seen many people, including some artists I deeply admire, lost their files due to sudden stop of some applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premier Pro, etc. It’s a shame that such things always happen.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I’m pretty familiar with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free and open source distributed version control system. Since it’s a version control system, it certainly can do backup jobs.</p>

<h3 id="how-about-cloud-storage-services">How about Cloud Storage Services?</h3>
<p>One thing I think Cloud Storage Services really lack of is git-like file management. If I changed a file, and at some point, I want the older version of that file, Cloud Storage Services really don’t do much help with that. But with Git, you can checkout any version of any file. Isn’t that <strong>super cool</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="cross-folder">Cross-folder</h3>
<p>Git is indeed one of the best softwares that everybody should learn how to use. But not everyone has the time and the energy to do that.</p>

<p>Apple launched SwiftUI in 2019, then I thought maybe I could do something with it. so I launched this project, to provide git-like file management functionality, but with better experience. You don’t have to learn how to use git. Just select files to create a backup, BaXup will copy the files you selected periodically and make a commit for you, which you can use to export files later.</p>

<h3 id="issue">Issue</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BaXup/BaXup.github.io">Here</a> is the official repository of BaXup. If you encouter any problem when using BaXup, feel free to file an issue.</p>

<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<p>Thanks for using BaXup. But currently BaXup does not accept any kind of support.</p>
