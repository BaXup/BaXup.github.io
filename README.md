### Why this?

I've seen many people, including some artists I deeply admire, lost their files due to sudden stop of some applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premier Pro, etc. It's a shame that such things always happen.

As a programmer, I'm pretty familiar with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a free and open source distributed version control system. Since it's a version control system, it certainly can do backup jobs.

### How about Cloud Storage Services?
One thing I think Cloud Storage Services really lack of is git-like file management. If I changed a file, and at some point, I want the older version of that file, Cloud Storage Services really don't do much help with that. But with Git, you can checkout any version of any file. Isn't that **super cool**?

### Cross-folder
Git is indeed one of the best softwares that everybody should learn how to use. But not everyone has the time and the energy to do that.

Apple launched SwiftUI in 2019, then I thought maybe I could do something with it. so I launched this project, to provide git-like file management functionality, but with better experience. You don't have to learn how to use git. Just select files to create a backup, BaXup will copy the files you selected periodically and make a commit for you, which you can use to export files later.
